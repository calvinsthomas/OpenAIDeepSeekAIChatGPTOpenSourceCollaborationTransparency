# Instructions for Screenshot 2025-09-27 130131.png

## Problem Statement
The file "Screenshot 2025-09-27 130131.png" is configured to be stored in Git LFS and must be pushed using the Git command line with Git LFS installed.

## Solution

### Step 1: Rename File (Required)
The filename doesn't follow repository conventions. Rename it first:

```bash
# If the file exists, rename it to follow conventions
mv "Screenshot 2025-09-27 130131.png" "screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png"
```

### Step 2: Validate File
Use our validation script to ensure it's ready for LFS:

```bash
./scripts/validate_lfs_file.sh screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png
```

### Step 3: Add to Git LFS
Add the file normally - LFS will handle it automatically:

```bash
git add screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png
```

### Step 4: Verify LFS Handling
Confirm the file will be handled by LFS:

```bash
git lfs status
# Should show: screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png (LFS: xxxxxx)
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push
**CRITICAL**: Must use Git command line for LFS files:

```bash
# Commit the file
git commit -m "Add screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png"

# Push using Git command line (REQUIRED for LFS)
git push origin main
```

## Why Git Command Line is Required

Git LFS files **cannot** be uploaded via:
- ❌ GitHub web interface
- ❌ Some GUI Git clients
- ❌ Drag-and-drop uploads

They **must** be pushed via:
- ✅ Git command line
- ✅ Git-enabled IDEs with proper LFS support

## Verification Commands

After pushing, verify the upload worked:

```bash
# Check LFS objects in repository
git lfs ls-files

# Verify file is in LFS
git lfs status

# Check LFS object was uploaded
git lfs ls-files | grep screenshot_2025-09-27_130131
```

## Alternative: If File Doesn't Exist

If you need to create this file:

```bash
# Create a properly named screenshot file
# (Replace with your actual screenshot)
cp your_screenshot.png screenshot_2025-09-27_130131.png

# Follow steps 2-5 above
```

## Troubleshooting

### "File not tracked by LFS"
```bash
# Verify .gitattributes has PNG configured
grep "*.png" .gitattributes
# Should show: *.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

### "LFS object not found"
```bash
# Pull LFS objects
git lfs pull

# Or re-initialize LFS
git lfs install
```

### "Push failed"
```bash
# Ensure you're using command line
git push origin main

# Check LFS installation
git lfs version
```
