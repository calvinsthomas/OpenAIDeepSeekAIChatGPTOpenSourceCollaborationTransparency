# QXR Custom Workflow Loader

A flexible system for triggering QXR workflows through file-based commands, specifically designed to handle the `.mp4` directory command structure.

## Overview

The Custom Workflow Loader monitors and processes workflow commands stored in file system triggers, enabling automated execution of the main QXR social media integration workflow.

## Problem Statement Addressed

**"On .mp4, loadmymainquantQXRworkflowcustomnow!"**

This implementation provides:
- Detection of command files in the `.mp4` directory
- Automatic parsing and execution of QXR workflow commands
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- Direct execution scripts for immediate workflow triggers

## File Structure

```
.mp4/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loadmymainquantQXRworkflowcustomnow!  # Command trigger file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run_qxr_workflow.py                   # Direct execution script

QXR/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_workflow_loader.py             # Main loader implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qxr_main.py                          # Core QXR workflow
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README_CUSTOM_WORKFLOW.md            # This file

logs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_workflows/                     # Execution logs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_workflow_execution_*.json
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Direct Execution from .mp4 Directory
```bash
cd .mp4
python run_qxr_workflow.py
```

### Method 2: Using the Custom Workflow Loader
```bash
# Single execution
python QXR/custom_workflow_loader.py

# Monitor mode (continuous monitoring)
python QXR/custom_workflow_loader.py --monitor

# Help
python QXR/custom_workflow_loader.py --help
```

### Method 3: Standard QXR Workflow
```bash
python QXR/qxr_main.py
```

## Command File Format

The command file `.mp4/loadmymainquantQXRworkflowcustomnow!` contains:
```
loadmymainquantQXRworkflowcustomnow!
```

This command is parsed to:
- **Action**: `load_qxr_workflow`
- **Custom Mode**: `true` (contains "customnow")
- **Execution**: Full QXR social media integration workflow

## Features

### üîç Command Processing
- Automatic detection of command files
- Intelligent parsing of workflow commands
- Support for custom execution modes

### üìä Execution Logging
- Detailed JSON logs for each execution
- Timestamp tracking and performance metrics
- Error handling and success reporting

### üîÑ Monitoring Capabilities
- Continuous file monitoring mode
- Automatic execution on command file changes
- Daemon-style operation for automated workflows

### üöÄ Integration
- Seamless integration with existing QXR workflow
- Bridge-accelerated processing when available
- Full compatibility with enhanced social media engine

## Generated Files

Each execution creates:

1. **Social Media Posts**: `/tmp/qxr_bridge_posts_[timestamp].json`
   - LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Notion content
   - Performance metrics and processing times
   - Bridge version information

2. **Execution Logs**: `logs/custom_workflows/custom_workflow_execution_[timestamp].json`
   - Execution metadata and timing
   - Command processing details
   - Success/failure status

## Workflow Output

The custom workflow loader triggers the full QXR integration which includes:

- ‚úÖ ETHLIQENGDOTIPYNBNTBK notebook processing
- ‚úÖ Statistical arbitrage signal extraction
- ‚úÖ Multi-platform social media content generation
- ‚úÖ COMBSEC authentication integration
- ‚úÖ Notion Backtest Sim Landing Page creation
- ‚úÖ Bridge-accelerated performance optimization

## Security Features

- **COMBSEC Integration**: Secure key authentication
- **Execution Logging**: Complete audit trail
- **Command Validation**: Safe command processing
- **NEWWORLDODOR Context**: Security protocol compliance

## Error Handling

The system handles:
- Missing command files
- Invalid command formats
- Workflow execution failures
- Import/dependency issues
- File system permissions

## Integration with QXR Ecosystem

This custom workflow loader integrates with:
- **QXR Main Workflow** (`qxr_main.py`)
- **Enhanced Social Media Engine** (Bridge integration)
- **Notion Page Generator** (Landing page creation)
- **COMBSEC System** (Authentication)
- **GraphQL Resolvers** (API integration)

## Performance

- **Bridge Acceleration**: 10-100x faster processing when available
- **Minimal Overhead**: Direct command file monitoring
- **Efficient Logging**: JSON-based structured logs
- **Fast Execution**: Sub-second command processing

## Examples
